<div class="textblock"><p>This is an implementation of Schoof's algorithm for counting the points on elliptic curves over finite fields (Schoof, René. Elliptic curves over finite fields and the computation of square roots mod p. <em>Mathematics of Computation</em>, 44(170):483–494, 1985).</p>
<p>Elliptic curve cryptographic algorithms base their security guarantees on the number of points on the used elliptic curve. Because naive point counting is infeasible, having a fast counting algorithm is important to swiftly decide whether a curve is safe to use in cryptography or not. René Schoof's algorithm for counting the points on an elliptic curve over a finite field is the foundation for the (asymptotically) fastest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schoof%E2%80%93Elkies%E2%80%93Atkin_algorithm" title="Schoof-Elkies-Atkin algorithm for counting points on elliptic curves over finite fields.">Schoof–Elkies–Atkin</a> counting algorithm.</p>
<p><b>Implementation.</b> The implementation is written in <a href="http://python.org" title="Python Programming Language">Python 3</a> and is kept as simple as possible. Its goal is to give insight into the mathematics of the algorithm without the use of (too) high-level concepts. For a (pretty) gentle introduction into why and how Schoof's algorithm works, please read my diploma thesis titled <a href="http://www.elwedgo.de/fileadmin/elwedgo.de/portfolio/diploma_thesis_math/dinges-elementary_schoof_derivation-thesis.pdf">*An Elementary Derivation and Implementation of Schoof's Algorithm for Counting Points on Elliptic Curves*</a>. In the thesis, I try to explain <em>how one might get the idea for the algorithm</em>. This understanding of <em>why</em> things look the way they do is often neglected in mathematics.</p>
<p>Schoof's algorithm uses arithmetic on elliptic curves, finite fields, rings of polynomials, and quotient rings. This repository therefore contains Python modules for all these concepts that can be used on their own.</p>
<h2>System Requirements</h2>
<p>The algorithm is implemented in version 3.1 of <a href="http://python.org" title="Python Programming Language">Python</a>, an open licensed dynamic programming language available on all common platforms. To find out whether a compatible version of Python is already installed on your system, execute <code>python --version</code> in a terminal. The command will return the version number if Python is available. Note that the version 3 interpreter could also be named <code>python3</code>. Please see the <em>Using Python</em> part of Python's <a href="http://docs.python.org/py3k/using/index.html" title="Python Setup and Usage">documentation</a> for system installation instructions; follow the steps below to set up Python locally in your account.</p>
<h3>Local Installation from Source Code</h3>
<p>Installing Python from source code requires a C compiler; on Linux and Unix systems, one is almost always available. The following steps install Python on a Linux system:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Download.</b> Download the source tar ball of version 3.1 or later from the Python website at <a href="http://www.python.org/download/releases/">http://www.python.org/download/releases/</a>.</li>
<li><p class="startli"><b>Compile.</b> Open a terminal and create a temporary directory, say <code>${HOME}/tmp/</code>, by executing <code>mkdir ${HOME}/tmp/</code>. Change into the temporary directory and extract the source tar ball: <code>cd ${HOME}/tmp/</code> and then <code>tar xzvf Python-3.1.2.tgz</code>; adjust the path and file name accordingly. If you downloaded the bzipped source tar ball, use <code>tar xjvf Python-3.1.2.tar.bz2</code> instead.</p>
<p class="startli">Next, change into the directory that contains the extracted source code, for instance <code>${HOME}/tmp/Python-3.1.2/</code>. Configure the build system by executing <code>./configure --prefix=${HOME}/python3</code>. The prefix is the path that will be the root of the Python installation, so adjust it to taste. In case required components are missing, the command will exit with an error message. In this case, please install the components and re-execute <code>configure</code>.</p>
<p class="startli">If everything worked, then the last line of output by <code>configure</code> will be <code>creating Makefile</code>. To start the compilation, execute <code>make</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><b>Install.</b> Use <code>make install</code> to install Python after the compilation finished.</li>
<li><p class="startli"><b>Set Up Environment.</b> To enable the local Python installation, add its interpreter and modules to the respective search paths: execute <code>export PATH=${HOME}/python3/bin:${PATH}</code> to tell the shell where to find the <code>python3</code> interpreter; adjust the path to your prefix for <code>configure</code>. Likewise, execute <code>export PYTHONPATH=${HOME}/python3/lib/python3.1</code> to tell Python where to find its modules.</p>
<p class="startli">Note that the scope of <code>export</code> is the current shell. Thus you have to issue both commands in every freshly opened terminal you wish to use for Python 3.1 programs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Program Execution</h2>
<p>The implementations work without any installation; they may be executed directly from the checked out repository. However, they expect a set up Python 3.1 run-time environment as explained above.</p>
<p>The root directory contains the point counting programs: the file <code><a class="el" href="naive__schoof_8py_source.html">naive_schoof.py</a></code> is the implementation discussed in {sec:implementation}; the file <code><a class="el" href="reduced__computation__schoof_8py_source.html">reduced_computation_schoof.py</a></code> is the version with better constants using a smarter computation order and Hasse's theorem. Curves for counting are specified as space-separated triples <em>p</em>, <em>A</em>, and <em>B</em>: <em>p</em> is the prime size of the galois field <em>GF[p]</em>, and <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are the curve parameters.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Suppose you want to count the number of points on the elliptic curve over <em>GF[23]</em> with parameters <em>A=4</em> and <em>B=2</em>. If the current directory in the terminal is the repository root, then executing <code>python3 <a class="el" href="naive__schoof_8py_source.html">naive_schoof.py</a> 23 4 2</code> yields the output</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">Counting points on y^2 = x^3 + 4x + 2 over GF&lt;23&gt;: 21</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><h3>Command Line Parameters</h3>
<p>The program supports the command line options described below, which for instance allow to read the curves from a file, or to create execution profiles for performance analysis.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>--version</code>: Show program's version number and exit.</li>
<li><code>-h</code>, <code>--help</code>: Show a help message and exit.</li>
<li><code>-i</code> <em>f</em>, <code>--input-file=</code>*f*: Read the curve parameters from file <em>f</em>. Lines in <em>f</em> must contain either a comment, or a space-separated triple of curve parameters <em>p</em>, <em>A</em>, and <em>B</em>. Comment lines start with a hash (<code>#</code>); these and empty lines are skipped.</li>
<li><code>-o</code> <em>f</em>, <code>--output-file=</code>*f*: Write the results to file <em>f</em> instead of showing them on the terminal. Each line of input generates one corresponding line of output.</li>
<li><code>-t</code> <em>s</em>, <code>--timelimit=</code>*s*: Terminate the program if processing an input triple takes longer than <em>s</em> seconds. The program ends if the time limit expires; no subsequent lines will be read from an input file. Thus, sort the parameters in input files ascending in length of the prime <em>p</em> to avoid triggering the time limit too early.</li>
<li><code>-p</code>, <code>--create-profile</code>: Create an execution profile for each processed input triple. The profile consists of a call profile generated with the <code>cProfile</code> Python module, and a file with data about elapsed time and used memory.</li>
<li><code>-d</code> <em>d</em>, <code>--profile-directory=</code>*d*: If profiling is enabled with the <code>-p</code> flag, then the collected data is written to the directory <em>d</em>. The default value is the current directory.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Profiling Tools</h2>
<p>The <code>tools/</code> directory contains several programs to post-process profiles resulting from a set <code>-p</code> flag. For example, it includes a call profile converter that outputs <a href="http://valgrind.org/info/tools.html" title="Callgrind is part of the Valgrind tool suite">Callgrind</a> files. Use <a href="http://kcachegrind.sourceforge.net/html/Home.html" title="Interactive viewer for Callgrind files.">KCacheGrind</a> to interactively inspect Callgrind files.</p>
<h2>Further Documentation</h2>
<p>The implementation comes with extensive <a href="http://www.elwedgo.de/fileadmin/elwedgo.de/portfolio/diploma_thesis_math/apidoc/namespaces.html">API documentation</a> that explains the purpose and usage of all classes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the directory <code>_test</code> contains unit tests to verify correct arithmetic. The unit tests are designed to be easily extended to further implementations of the same objects. Thus, mistakes in new designs should be simpler to locate. To run the unit tests, execute <code>python3 -m _test</code> in the repository root directory.</p>
